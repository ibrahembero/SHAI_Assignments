# SHAI_Assignments
## Data Analysis With Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### These Assignments For SHAI Bootcamp And Each Assignment Contains Important Analysis For Specific Data Set Using most important libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlip, Seaborn, with understanding the business need for our data set and see if there are missing or duplicate values and deal with them the right way after seeing plots for each feater and the correlation between them. Moving to build models and train them with our data after process it the right way. :smiley: :wink:
